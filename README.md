To run application you need: 
1. node version: v18.18.0
2. npm version: 10.2.0

Then you need to:
- <projectRoot> cd backend && npm install - to install node modules

For client you need: 
- <projectRoot> cd client && npm install - to install node modules

Then you need to set environment variable named as "mongoDBlink" and link will be provide via email.

After env variable is set you can start the project with command: 
- <projectRoot> cd client
- npm run dev

This will automatically run client and backend (backend is on port 5000, client is on port 3000).
Whole application is on port 3001.
